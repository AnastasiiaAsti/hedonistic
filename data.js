        label:'Croquetas De Jamón Serrano',
        ingredients:['Serrano ham', 'butter', 'olive oil', 'onion', 'flour', 'milk', 'salt', 'nutmeg', 'bread crumbs', 'egg'],
        stepOne: 'Start by heating the butter and oil in a heavy pan. When fully melted and hot, add the onions and sauté for about five minutes — until just starting to color',
        stepTwo: 'Next, add the nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Mix and then add the diced Serrano ham and cook for no more than a minute. Add the flour and sauté, mixing constantly to cook the flour as much as possible without burning it. Once it is browned a bit (photo 6) it’s time to add the milk.',
        stepThree: 'Now begin to add the milk, little by little, over the next 15-20 minutes. Every time the mixture gets dry, add some more milk. Stir constantly, and once the dough is creamy and thick it’s ready to cool.',
        stepFour: 'Pour the croquette dough into a large bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Cover it with plastic wrap (directly on the dough) and store it in the fridge for at least four hours (but ideally overnight). When it’s cool, take it out of the fridge and make little croquette logs using a metal spoon for help.',
        stepFive: 'First, prepare flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs in separate bowls. This is a simple three step breading process: cover in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. Place on top of wax paper if you wish so they don’t stick. Finally, it’s time to fry your croquettes! Heat olive oil in a heavy frying pan and once hot (but not smoking) add the croquettes. Turn them mid way to ensure they brown evenly on all sides. They should take about five minutes to fry. Remove and resist the urge to bite in right away (you don’t want to burn yourself!). After about five minutes give them a try!',
